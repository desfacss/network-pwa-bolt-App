Let's break down what's happening in these scenarios:

Online Adding an Item:
Item Creation and Saving:
The item is added to the cache (A6, A7), and an attempt is made to save it to Supabase (A1).
mutatingItems is updated to include the new item's ID, which is confirmed by the log Updated mutatingItems: [4330].
Mutation Status:
Initially, when the new item (ID: 4330) is added, its mutation status is true because it's in mutatingItems and isOnline is true. This indicates that the logic in rowClassName is working for the moment the mutation is active.
After the item is successfully saved to Supabase (A3), the mutation status for this item goes to false because it's removed from mutatingItems in the onSettled callback (Removed from mutatingItems: []).
Observations:
The behavior here seems correct; the style is applied to the new item while it's being saved and then removed once the mutation is settled.

Going Offline:
Network Status:
isOnline correctly updates to false when going offline.
Mutation Status:
All records show false for mutation status, which is expected since there's no ongoing mutation when you go offline.

Offline Adding an Item:
Item Creation:
The item is added to the cache (A6, A7), but there's no attempt to save to Supabase since you're offline.
Mutation Status:
All items, including the newly added one, show false for mutation status. This is unexpected because:
isOnline is false as per your logs (Network Status: false), which should satisfy the condition !isOnline && mutatingItems.includes(record.id) if mutatingItems includes the new item's ID.
Potential Issues:
It appears mutatingItems might not be updating or persisting correctly when offline. The new item's ID should be added to mutatingItems when you attempt to create it offline, but it seems this isn't reflecting in the rowClassName check.

Solutions and Observations:
Offline Mutation Handling:
When offline, ensure that mutatingItems is updated to include the ID of the newly added item. You've seen the ID being added when online, but this doesn't seem to happen or persist when offline.
State Persistence:
If you're using react-query, make sure your offline mutations are stored in a way that they'll be attempted once you go online. This includes keeping items in mutatingItems until they are successfully synced.
Check mutatingItems Update Logic:
Add more logging to confirm mutatingItems is updated when adding an item offline:
jsx
mutationFn: async (item) => {
  setMutatingItems(prev => {
    const newMutatingItems = [...prev, item.id];
    console.log('Offline, updated mutatingItems:', newMutatingItems);
    return newMutatingItems;
  });
  // ... rest of the function
},
Ensure isOnline is Correctly Used:
The combination of !isOnline and mutatingItems.includes(record.id) should work, but it's not reflecting here. You might need to review how isOnline affects your component's render.
Force Rerender:
If mutatingItems is updating but not causing a rerender, consider using useEffect with mutatingItems as a dependency to trigger a rerender:
jsx
useEffect(() => {
  console.log('mutatingItems changed:', mutatingItems);
}, [mutatingItems]);
Review Error Handling for Offline Operations:
The errors for fetching user data indicate you're handling offline scenarios in other parts of your app. Ensure this error handling extends to your item addition logic.
