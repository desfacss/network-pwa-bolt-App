Persisting QueryClient State:
Purpose: To keep the state of the QueryClient (which manages queries and mutations) even when the user refreshes the page or goes offline. This includes:
Query Results: Storing API responses in local storage so they can be used offline.
Mutation State: Keeping track of mutation operations for syncing later.
Implementation:
We're using persistQueryClient from @tanstack/react-query-persist-client to save the QueryClient state to localStorage via createSyncStoragePersister from @tanstack/query-sync-storage-persister. This setup allows for automatic persistence of the query cache when the application state changes.
Offline Database Management:
Purpose: To manage an offline database (IndexedDB) where data can be stored when offline and synced when online. This includes:
Storing Data Offline: When offline, data operations like adding, updating, or deleting items are stored locally.
Sync Queue: A queue for operations that need to be synced with the server once connectivity is restored.
Implementation:
OfflineDB: We've created an OfflineDB class using Dexie.js for IndexedDB management. This handles the local storage of data when offline.
SyncQueue: The SyncQueue class manages a queue of operations. When the app goes online, it processes these operations to sync with the server.

From Where Are We Updating offlineDB?
Direct Updates in CRUD Operations:
Add Item: When a user adds a new item, the addItem function from OfflineDB is called directly within mutation hooks to add the item to IndexedDB.
Update Item: Similarly, when updating an item, updateItem from OfflineDB is used to update the local IndexedDB.
Delete Item: The deleteItem function removes the item from IndexedDB when a delete operation is performed.
Sync Queue Management:
Operations (create, update, delete) are also added to the syncQueue for later processing. This happens right after updating the offlineDB:
addToSyncQueue is called after each operation to queue the operation for syncing with the server when online.
Mutation Hooks:
In the MainComponent (now DynState), mutations (createMutation, updateMutation, deleteMutation) use these OfflineDB functions. After performing the optimistic UI update, they then update the local database:
onMutate in mutations adds or updates the data in offlineDB before the server operation (for optimistic UI updates).
After a successful server operation, the data in offlineDB is considered up-to-date with the server, but this isn't explicitly updated in your code since the focus is on syncing the queue when online.
Syncing Process:
The useSyncQueue hook checks if there's a network connection and processes the queue accordingly. When the device comes online, syncQueue.process() will attempt to sync the queued operations with the server, updating offlineDB based on the server's response if necessary.

This setup ensures that the application can function offline with local data management and synchronization capabilities when connectivity is restored.
