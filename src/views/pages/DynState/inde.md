Given these logs, let's analyze both scenarios:

While Online:
Creating and Saving Item: 
You see logs for adding to mutatingItems (A0), attempting to save to Supabase (A1), and confirming the save (A3).
The mutation seems to complete successfully (Settling mutation for item: 1625 Error: null).
Mutation Status: 
Despite the item being added and saved, the Mutation status for all records, including the new one, remains false. This suggests:
The styling (optimistic-update) isn't applied because mutatingItems does not contain the new item's ID when rowClassName is evaluated, or 
isOnline is true, so !isOnline && mutatingItems.includes(record.id) evaluates to false.
Potential Issues:
There might be a delay in mutatingItems update reflecting in the UI, or 
The check mutatingItems.includes(record.id) might not be working as expected due to asynchronous state updates.

While Offline:
Creating Item:
The item is added to the cache (A6, A7), but there's no attempt to save to Supabase since you're offline.
Mutation Status:
All records, including the new one, show false for mutation status. 
This indicates that either isOnline is not correctly set to false at the time of rendering or mutatingItems isn't including the new item's ID for some reason at that moment.
Network Status: 
You see the network status change to false, which is good, but it doesn't seem to affect the mutation status check.

Solutions to Consider:
Check isOnline Timing:
Ensure that isOnline is false when you're offline and true when online. A delay here could cause issues.
Review mutatingItems Update:
Log mutatingItems right after setting it to confirm the ID is added:
jsx
setMutatingItems(prev => {
  const newMutatingItems = [...prev, item.id];
  console.log('Updated mutatingItems:', newMutatingItems);
  return newMutatingItems;
});
Force Rerender for Mutation State:
Use useEffect to log or force a rerender when mutatingItems changes:
jsx
useEffect(() => {
  console.log('mutatingItems updated:', mutatingItems);
}, [mutatingItems]);
Adjust rowClassName Logic:
Simplify or expand the logic to ensure it's correct:
jsx
rowClassName={(record) => {
  console.log('Network Status:', isOnline, 'Mutation status for record:', record.id, mutatingItems.includes(record.id));
  return !isOnline && mutatingItems.includes(record.id) ? 'optimistic-update' : '';
}}
Check for Asynchronous Updates:
React's state updates can be asynchronous. If setMutatingItems doesn't immediately reflect in the UI, you might need to manage this with a ref or similar to ensure immediate visual feedback.
Mutation Lifecycle:
Ensure that both online and offline states are handled correctly in your mutation hooks. Specifically, make sure onSettled only removes items from mutatingItems when appropriate.
